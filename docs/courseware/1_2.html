  In our first exercise we explored how to ask the right questions, how to refine them, and how to include the appropriate viewpoints and goals for the highest impact. 
  <br><br>
  Now that we have the right questions, it’s time to define those questions in terms of the data that we have, the data that we need, and organize the data as it makes sense for the project.

    <b>Focus on the Outcome</b>
    It’s very easy to get lost in “analysis paralysis” now that you have a question.<br>
    Whether this is just being overwhelmed by the sea of available data, not knowing where to look for data, being unsure if you can trust the data quality, or just trying to “do it all” at once.<br>
    It’s important that the outcome is kept as a focal point throughout the process.<br> 
    Don’t try to let your data dictate what is important, the goal or outcome should tell you what data needs to be gathered and used.
    <br><br>
    <b>Identify the right metrics</b>
    Having the right metrics is obviously important, but having the right context is even more important, especially as your data and analysis evolves over time.<br>
    As a part of the kickoff exercise you undoubtedly selected something tangible to measure against.<br>
    One way to think about this is as the “One Metric That Matters” (OMTM), and it is this more than anything else that you need to be sure is rock solid.<br>
    It’s worth exploring the provenance and methodology of how this data is created to ensure it has the solidity to act as a foundation for your data project.

    In addition to your OMTM it is important to also gather some ancillary information so that you have context to frame and support your main metrics.<br>
    This can help to better understand when something has gone haywire and can keep you honest.<br>
    While the instinctive reaction to “gather ancillary data” is going to be to include a ton of supporting info into a dashboard (or series of dashboards) beware of data overload!<br>
    <u>Having too much data is just as bad, or worse, than not enough data</u>.<br>
    While each project is going to have its own requirements, a good rule of thumb might be to start with 3-5 metrics you can monitor over time and discuss regularly with your team.

    <h1>Importance of the "Right" Data</h1>
  </div>
  <aside class="notes">
    In the post-big-data-capability era, organizations will often gather massive amounts and varieties of data simply because they can.
    <br><br>
    Very rarely is that necessary.
    <br><br>
    The trick is finding the “right” data, so we need to ask ourselves several questions to start, and continually evaluate what we are doing to ensure that it is focused and fruitful.

    A popular principle in computer science that suggests that flawed input results in equally flawed output. 
    <br><br>
    Unfortunately the need to consider this has only been magnified with the continued increase in power of computers. 
    <br><br>
    Supercomputers (or even our laptops) are capable of producing large amounts of erroneous data in a very short time, but the fact that they spent time crunching the data can lead to a “Garbage in, Gospel Out” where people seem to put excessive trust in computed data and blindly accept the output.

    <h1>Spectrum of Open vs Closed</h1>
  </div>
  <aside class="notes">
    Often people will ask if it’s better to adopt an open data view, or continue to operate on the principle that data is a proprietary asset that should be protected. The flippant answer is “Yes” or “why not both!?” The reality is usually much more complicated. There are absolutely advantages to open data, and the ability for many hands to make light work. However, there are times when data is something that cannot or should not be shared (ex: personal/financial/health info or internal data that could compromise shareholder value). The best solution usually involves a blend of both open and closed data. And even open needs to be defined; you need to consider “open to the world” vs “open to a close team” or something in between.

    A lot of the time, when people talk about open data, most listeners assume that this is a binary relationship. Either your data is open or it's closed. This couldn't be further from the truth. <br/>Here we have a very rudimentary spectrum of open, but there are shades of gray up and down this scale. While there are tons of benefits for making your data as open as possible, sometimes circumstances wont allow that (ex: regulated financial data, PII/PHI, etc)
