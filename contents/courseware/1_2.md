    <h1>Defining Constraints for Questions</h1>
  </div>
  <aside class="notes">
  In our first exercise we explored how to ask the right questions, how to refine them, and how to include the appropriate viewpoints and goals for the highest impact. 
  <br><br>
  Now that we have the right questions, it’s time to define those questions in terms of the data that we have, the data that we need, and organize the data as it makes sense for the project.

    <b>Focus on the Outcome</b>
    It’s very easy to get lost in “analysis paralysis” now that you have a question.<br>
    Whether this is just being overwhelmed by the sea of available data, not knowing where to look for data, being unsure if you can trust the data quality, or just trying to “do it all” at once.<br>
    It’s important that the outcome is kept as a focal point throughout the process.<br> 
    Don’t try to let your data dictate what is important, the goal or outcome should tell you what data needs to be gathered and used.
    <br><br>
    <b>Identify the right metrics</b>
    Having the right metrics is obviously important, but having the right context is even more important, especially as your data and analysis evolves over time.<br>
    As a part of the kickoff exercise you undoubtedly selected something tangible to measure against.<br>
    One way to think about this is as the “One Metric That Matters” (OMTM), and it is this more than anything else that you need to be sure is rock solid.<br>
    It’s worth exploring the provenance and methodology of how this data is created to ensure it has the solidity to act as a foundation for your data project.

        <p>Let's examine an exercise in evaluating data that someone else has gathered. Some of it has been sourced and imported, one of the datasets is off on another site and will need to be added.</p>

        <li>Avoid data overload!</li>
        <li>3-5 supporting metrics</li>
        <li>Define and regularly revisit</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <aside class="notes">
    In addition to your OMTM it is important to also gather some ancillary information so that you have context to frame and support your main metrics.<br>
    This can help to better understand when something has gone haywire and can keep you honest.<br>
    While the instinctive reaction to “gather ancillary data” is going to be to include a ton of supporting info into a dashboard (or series of dashboards) beware of data overload!<br>
    <u>Having too much data is just as bad, or worse, than not enough data</u>.<br>
    While each project is going to have its own requirements, a good rule of thumb might be to start with 3-5 metrics you can monitor over time and discuss regularly with your team.
