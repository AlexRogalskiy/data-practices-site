    Once you have gathered all of your disparate data sources the trick is to combine them into a single useful resource. 
    <br><br>
    There are many tools and processes available to aid in this procedure, but it can often be a very time consuming and technical process.

    <h1>Profiling Data</h1>
  </div>
  <aside class="notes">
  Anytime you start a new data project, you should first strive to get a working understanding of what the data you have “looks like.” 
  <br><br>
  This can include a number of qualitative and quantitative evaluations, but generally you’ll want to examine your data for cleanliness, accuracy, reliability, and validity.

        <h2 class="larger">Accuracy</h2>
        <p>In this context, Accuracy is more about the "precision" of the measurement, rather than the errors or unpredictability.</p>
        <p><b>Example:</b> "measuring the weight of a commodity such as rice using an appropriate balance would be considered an accurate measurement. If, howerver, the balance only measured in 0.5 kilo intervals, forcing you to judge between these intervals, you would not consider your measurement to be accurate."</p>

    This is a term often linked to quantitative data measurements.

        <p>Checking the distribution of data to determine if any outliers are "true" or the result of errors in measurement or recording.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Non-binary</li>
            <li>More rigorous in research settings</li>
            <li>Hard to measure absolutely</li>
            <li>In a real world setting, more useful to use this as a litmus test for how much "wiggle room" you are willing to accept in data that isn't generated by you.</li>

        <p>Does the data measure what it purports to measure?"
        <ul>
            <li>Easiest way is to engage a Subject Matter Expert</li>
            <li>Often subjective or visceral</li>
            <li>In some cases there is an established reference to compare against</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <aside class="notes">
    Reliability is “are these repeatable and fall within accepted tolerances”
    <br><br>
    Validity is “are the measurements actually a representation of what I’m trying to measure.”
