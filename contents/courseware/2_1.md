        Now that we have looked at some academic answers to the problem, I wanted to explore one specific application of these principles.
        <br><br>
        data.world wrote a position paper internally to help solidify their approach to the data ecosystem. In it we can cover the main points, but I wanted to read one paragraph to start:
        <br><br>
        <i>We believe that data can transform the world, causing an unprecedented boom in efficiency and effectiveness.  Data can make the world smaller by connecting people to problems and solutions.  Data can radically change company cultures too.  As William Gibson (speculative fiction author) said, “The future is already here — it’s just not very evenly distributed.”  The future is already here at a handful of companies that have transformed their industries.  Airbnb, Warby Parker, Facebook, Google, and Amazon were literally built from the ground up to take advantage of data.  At Airbnb, their fifth employee was a Data Scientist.  Today, they have their own data catalog, where 45% of their 3,100 employees regularly engage with it.  At Warby Parker, they have a similar data catalog but in this case 80% of their employees are regularly engaged in it.  Traditional Fortune 500 and Global 2000 companies are lucky if even 1% of their employees are doing the same - or if they have a democratized data catalog in the first place.  Most don’t even measure this percentage - ask them.  These traditional companies weren’t built from the ground up around data - they were built from the ground up around atoms, not bits (Mike Maples Jr., investor).  The new order of the world is that bits will control atoms.  This creates many exciting opportunities but it is very scary for traditional companies.  In the 2018 NewVantage Partner’s Big Data Executive Survey, traditional companies fears of highly agile, data-driven competitors has jumped to 79.4% (jumping significantly from 47% in 2017).</i>

        The first major hurdle that companies face when trying to become data driven is that their data infrastructure (if they can even claim to have one) is very disparate and segmented/siloed.
        <br><br>
        Consider the listed data sources. How many of these sources do you have? Especially consider "dark data" (anything that is not easily accesible or perhaps completely unsanctioned)
        <br><br>
        The keys, as you build this, are to solve for accessibility, interoperability, and ease-of-use. Consider tool agnosticism and collaboration.

        While integrity and security are important considerations for data governance, you should balance that against availability and usability.
        <br><br>
        As your organization operationalizes data, prioritize those data that can have broad impact and encourage (or enforce) people's use so that decisions are made from the same data. 
        <br><br>
        While many people consider governance to be unnecessary “gating” in front of your data, and the associated work around it, there are ways to achieve good data governance without getting in the way.

    Define your version of “open”
    The first step in your journey to building a data-driven culture is understanding what “open” means to you and your organization. Most people assume that open just means “open to the world” and have an immediate visceral reaction. There are many different steps to open, and deciding what is right for your organization is essential to building your data ethos. The simplest breakdown is as follows:
    <br><br>
    <b>Open to your team</b>
    This first step helps to combat the “lone wolf data practitioner” challenge that many orgs face when first bringing in data workers. The difficulty here is that when there isn’t a strong data culture, workers tend to grab the data they need, pull it down to their laptop, and do all work in isolation.
    <br><br>
    <b>Open to your organization</b>
    This step is helping to break down the data silos that exist in your organization. So often small teams or business units will verticalize in the organization, but this step is helping to create a culture of openness and discourse across the entirety of your business. This is typically the most ideal, especially for a company who is new to “open” and just exploring how to build a data-driven culture.
    <br><br>
    <b>Open to the world</b>
    This is the most “advanced” version of open, and allows organizations to share data with the world. This is obviously not appropriate for all types of data, especially that which is sensitive or contains personally identifiable information or health information. The upside here is that when you are able to share data with the world you have the opportunity to build a broader community of practice and a network of practitioners who can create value even though they aren’t employees.

    So now we have a pretty robust toolbox of things to draw from. We're thinking about data through the lens of:
    <br><br>
    Access: "more collaboration"<br>
    Dictionary: "better definitions of data"<br>
    Literacy: "a workforce of people who use data"<br>
    Decisions: "our business decisions are driven by data"
